# VAR and BEGIN must be the first 2 lines of the script

# This script was written for v87 Chromebook enrollment (5/10/21)

# This script will enroll a Chromebook on the "Welcome" out-of-box screen, then check for ChromeOS updates and
# 	bring up hardware testing webpages for microphone, webcam, keyboard, and speaker (Sesame Street on Youtube).

# The asset ID and location fields will be LEFT AS IS meaning if there is no asset ID already associated with the device,
# 	then the asset ID will have to be added after enrollment via Google Control Panel.
