# DESCRIPTION
#   This script will enroll a Chromebook on the "Welcome" out-of-box screen, skipping the asset ID section, and open hardware testing webpages for microphone, webcam, keyboard, and speaker
#   This script was written for deprovisioned Chromebooks (e.g. back from TRA) whose wireless MAC is already approved for the Edina-Devices

# REQUIREMENTS
#   THE CHROMEBOOK MUST ALREADY BE APPROVED FOR EDINA-DEVICES TO OPERATE AS INTENDED
#   The asset ID prompt will be entered with whatever information is already prefilled, if any
#   Asset ID and Location will have to be entered after enrollment using tools such as Google Admin Control Panel (GCP)
#   This script has been tested on Chromebooks up to but not including v90
